## Description 

This webpage is a professional portfolio for possible employers to be able to look at my experience and previous work. This application will also alow possible employers to see a current photo of me, as well as a brief description of myself which includes my current location, and eventually a specialty or area of work I am particularly interested, as well as previous, relevant employment. 

This application includes a navigational header which includes operating links to later sections of the web application, and under the "My Work" section, the application features previously made applications, which include a screenshot, a link to the application, and a brief description of it. Future projects are intended to have the same layout as the first project, but smaller in size. 

By finishing this project, I was able to practice using and generating semantic HTML as well as more advanced CSS tricks. By using and practicing more advanced CSS, I gained a better understanding of it.

## Credits

I have consulted a few websites for help and/or inspiration for this project:

For aesthetic inspiration, I looked at multiple websites from this [list](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/web-developer-portfolio).

I took particular inspiration from The Craftsmen's [portolio](https://www.thecraftsmen.tech/), in regards to some aesthetics. 

I also looked at the css-tricks [website](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/transition/) for help with the :hover transition in regards to opacity.
